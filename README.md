## Workflow
step1:Data from kaggle webseite

step2:Cleaning the data as clear null values and drop a unwanted columns renamed as target and text columns

step3:EDA process to check the dataset is balanced or not and create words number and sentences

step4:Data preprocessing to understand the data and change in to the variables for model training

step5: NLP process to change a text in stemming words and neglect punctuation.

step5:Model building by using a tfidf vectorizer and multimoial gauusian naive bayes to identify the message is spam or not.

step6: Deployed the Model.


## Uses: 
This techniques enable AI email filtering can manage incoming malware and protect email users from developing spam complacency. They appear as poorly written emails with unnatural links, but they jeopardize business and personal data.
